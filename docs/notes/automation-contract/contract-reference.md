# Automation CLI Contract Reference

This reference freezes the wrapper-facing contract proven so far from preserved xEdit automation artifacts. JSON examples are linked to their source captures in `examples/` and are checked by the automation contract drift checker.

## Versioning

- Current `contractVersion`: `0.23`, accepted on the FO4 MO2-backed harness.
- Client rule: ignore unknown keys on objects and arrays unless a later contract version explicitly says otherwise.
- `supports.jobs.kinds` is frozen byte-for-byte across the `0.7` to `0.8` delta. The script-execution descriptors are adjacent to the job-kind list; script execution is not added to `jobs.*`.

## Capability discovery

Call `system.capabilities` before assuming wrapper behavior. Script-execution
fields to key on under `result.supports.scripts.execution` are:

- `synchronous: true`
- `cancelable: false`
- `overlapPolicy: "single-process-single-runner"`
- `busyHolders: ["daemon", "gui"]`
- `failureMessagesOnError: true`
- `iKnowWhatImDoing: false|true` reflecting daemon launch state

The 0.23 command-level capability flags are top-level members of
`result.supports`:

- `pendingSaveReadback: true`
- `sessionFlush: true`
- `sortableContainerNotice: true`

## Transport and framing

- Transport is a Windows named pipe.
- Pipe naming convention for a spawned daemon is `\\.\pipe\xedit-<pid>` where `<pid>` is the xEdit process ID written by the launcher state file.
- Requests and responses are UTF-8 JSON.
- One connection carries one request and one response; the client connects, writes a single JSON request object, reads one full JSON response message, and disconnects.
- Requests use the shape `{ "command": "<name>", "args": { ... } }`. An empty arg object is still an object (`{}`), not an array.

The frozen `supports.jobs.kinds` list remains:

1. `files.hygiene.batch`
2. `plugin.esl.analyze`
3. `plugin.esl.apply`
4. `plugin.formids.compact_for_esl`
5. `validation.check_for_errors`
6. `validation.check_for_itm`
7. `validation.check_for_deleted_refs`
8. `cleaning.quick_clean`
9. `cleaning.quick_auto_clean`
10. `cleaning.sort_and_clean_masters`

See `examples/01-capabilities.md` for the source-linked response.

## Locator semantics (0.22)

- Locator objects require `file`.
- `formId` is optional unless the addressed command requires a record identity.
- `path` is optional. Missing `path` defaults to the record root and resolves the
  same way as `path:""`.

## `records.copy_into` nil-copy diagnostics (0.22)

When native `wbCopyElementToFile` returns nil, `records.copy_into` still returns
`mutation_not_allowed`. In 0.22 it forwards the native gate reason when it can
identify one:

- `Source contains Reflection and can not be copied`
- `Source contains Unmapped FormID and can not be copied into a module which does not have the game master as its first master`

Other nil-copy failures keep the existing generic message:
`Automation records.copy_into could not identify the copied main record`.

## Element Mutation Verbs (0.11)

See `docs/plans/2026-06-07-xedit-phase13-elements-mutation-surface-design.md` §4 for canonical request/response shapes.

### `elements.set_native_value`

Typed `NativeValue` write. Optional `kind` enum: `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `formId`, `formIdArray`. Without `kind`, JSON type drives marshaling.

### `elements.set_to_default`, `elements.clear`

Mutation verbs deferring to native `IsEditable`/`IsClearable` predicates. Response includes `before` and `after` element envelopes.

### `elements.move_up`, `elements.move_down`, `elements.next_member`, `elements.previous_member`

Locator-drift family. Response includes `before.locator`, `after.locator`, top-level `locator` (post-mutation, authoritative), and `pathChanged: bool`. Caller MUST continue from `after.locator` after a successful operation.

### `elements.edit_capabilities`, `elements.assign_templates`

Read-only discovery. No consent gate. `edit_capabilities` returns `predicates`/`operations`/`assign` blocks; `assign_templates` returns a narrow template list.

### `elements.add_child` (extended)

Optional args:

- `targetIndex` (default `wbAssignAdd`)
- `templateIndex` / `templateName` — must agree if both provided
- Ambiguous multi-template targets without selector return `mutation_not_allowed` with `details.availableTemplates`. (Note: this refusal-with-details branch is implemented but unverified end-to-end against FO4 fixtures in 0.11 — no probed vanilla FO4 container exposed `assign_templates count >= 2`. Clients should prefer the two-call `assign_templates` + `add_child{templateName}` pattern.)

### `elements.copy_child_to` (extended)

Optional args:

- `targetIndex` (default `wbAssignAdd`)
- `addRequiredMasters` (default `false`)

Response includes `masters.added`/`alreadyPresent`/`skipped` and `placement.sortOrderApplied` (internal GUI-equivalent fixup).

### Error taxonomy

No new error codes. Reuse `invalid_request` / `invalid_target` / `read_only_target` / `mutation_not_allowed` / `consent_required` / `file_not_found` / `record_not_found` / `element_not_found`.

## Sortable containers and index stability

Some xEdit containers, including LVLI-style arrays, maintain their children in a
native sorted order. A successful child write invalidates that order; xEdit
applies the re-sort lazily on the next read that needs sorted children. Element
interfaces already captured by a script remain attached to the same elements,
but `ElementByIndex` and other index-based locators can resolve to different
children after the write.

Scripts must call `IsSorted` when they need to detect this hazard and capture all
`ElementByIndex` or `ElementByName` references before the first write. Mutate
through those captured interfaces. Do not re-resolve the remaining targets by
index after calling `SetEditValue`, `SetNativeValue`, or another child mutation.

On a successful `elements.set_value` or `elements.set_native_value` write beneath
a sorted container, the daemon adds these advisory result fields:

```json
{
  "sortInvalidated": true,
  "notice": "container is sorted; index-based locators may have moved after this write"
}
```

The notice never blocks or denies the write. The fields are absent when no
sorted-container invalidation occurred. Clients can discover this additive
surface through `supports.sortableContainerNotice: true`.

## `scripts.run` success envelope

Successful `scripts.run` stays synchronous. A success response has `ok: true`, `command: "scripts.run"`, and `result` fields including:

- `id`
- `compile.ok`
- `lintBypassed`
- `lintWarnings`
- `ranInitialize`
- `ranFinalize`
- `processed`
- `terminatedEarly`
- `terminationCode`
- `timedOut`
- `statementBudgetExceeded`
- `messages`
- `messagesTruncated`
- `dirtyFiles`

The success example in `examples/02-scripts-run-success.md` is a preserved real capture of the same success envelope shape; the docs-only contract pass did not change product code or rerun a new success fixture.

## `scripts.run` failure envelope

Failed `scripts.run` responses have `ok: false`, `command: "scripts.run"`, and `error` with stable `code`, human-readable `message`, and per-code `details`. Clients must branch on `error.code`, not on `error.message` text.

For lifecycle-bearing script failures, the contract includes:

- `error.details.messages`: ordered JSON array of captured script messages, present even when empty.
- `error.details.messagesTruncated`: boolean; `true` means one or more emitted messages were dropped or clipped before response emission.

See `examples/03-scripts-run-failure.md` for a runtime failure carrying `messages` and `messagesTruncated`.

## Per-code `error.details` catalog

Unknown future keys may appear. Clients should consume the documented keys below and ignore extra keys.

### `script_blocker_lint`

- `lintWarnings`
- `lintScope`

### `script_busy`

- `holder`

### `script_external_declaration_not_allowed`

- `sourceUnit`
- `line`
- `ranInitialize`
- `ranFinalize`
- `processed`
- `messages`
- `messagesTruncated`

### `script_compile_error`

- `errorLocation` when available
- `ranInitialize`
- `ranFinalize`
- `processed`
- `messages`
- `messagesTruncated`

### `script_timeout`

- `timeoutMs`
- `elapsedMs`
- `ranInitialize`
- `ranFinalize`
- `processed`
- `messages`
- `messagesTruncated`
- `preExistingDirtyFiles`
- `mutationsAppliedBeforeFailure`
- `modifiedFilesBeforeFailure` when `mutationsAppliedBeforeFailure` is true

### `script_statement_budget_exceeded`

- `maxStatements`
- `ranInitialize`
- `ranFinalize`
- `processed`
- `messages`
- `messagesTruncated`
- `preExistingDirtyFiles`
- `mutationsAppliedBeforeFailure`
- `modifiedFilesBeforeFailure` when `mutationsAppliedBeforeFailure` is true

### `script_runtime_error`

- `policyPreflight`
- `runtimeDenied`
- `deniedIdentifier` when denial was detected
- `preflightLine` and `preflightColumn` when `policyPreflight` is true
- `targetIndex` when Process-phase failure indexing is meaningful
- `ranInitialize`
- `ranFinalize`
- `processed`
- `messages`
- `messagesTruncated`
- `preExistingDirtyFiles`
- `mutationsAppliedBeforeFailure`
- `modifiedFilesBeforeFailure` when `mutationsAppliedBeforeFailure` is true

Runtime policy denials continue to normalize as `script_runtime_error` with `runtimeDenied: true`; this contract does not introduce `script_policy_denied`.

### Policy preflight scope

After compilation and before `Initialize`, the headless host scans the entry
script for call-shaped identifiers. Bare calls are checked against the JvI policy
ledger, host-resolved globals, routines declared in the entry script, and the
minimal Pascal keyword/type allowlist valid in call position. Dotted calls are
conservatively allowed because they may be instance methods on local variables,
and remain guarded by the runtime hook. A refusal keeps the existing
`script_runtime_error` envelope and adds `policyPreflight: true`,
`deniedIdentifier`, `preflightLine`, and `preflightColumn`. Its standard
`Access denied to '<identifier>: ...'` message also keeps `runtimeDenied: true`.
Because this refusal occurs before `Initialize`, no script mutation can occur.

This preflight deliberately covers entry-script call-shaped identifiers only.
Helper-unit symbols and instance-method calls on local object variables remain
the responsibility of the installed runtime hook, which stays authoritative for
argument-sensitive checks and every call preflight cannot classify. False-positive
control has priority over recall: an uncertain call is left to the runtime hook
rather than rejecting a working script before execution.

### Partial-mutation reporting

Runtime/exception, timeout, and statement-budget failures report the dirty-file
state observed around the failed run:

- `preExistingDirtyFiles` lists files that were already dirty before the run.
- `mutationsAppliedBeforeFailure` is true when the post-failure dirty-file set
  differs from the pre-run set.
- `modifiedFilesBeforeFailure`, emitted when that boolean is true, lists files
  newly dirtied by the failed run.

Dirty state is a per-file boolean, not a mutation generation counter. A file that
was dirty both before and after the run may or may not have been touched by the
run. Thus `mutationsAppliedBeforeFailure:false` means no newly dirty file was
observed; it is not proof that the script performed no write to a pre-dirty file.

## Script-side additions (0.23)

- `RecordByFormIDStrict(file, formId, allowInjected)` interprets `formId` in
  load-order space and resolves it through the owning file. It returns nil when
  that owner is neither `file` itself nor a member of its master chain, and never
  raises for an ownership mismatch. Legacy `RecordByFormID` is unchanged.
- `IntToStr64(value)` is registered in the script-visible `SysUtils` surface.
- `IntToHex(value, digits)` is the plain two-argument formatter with Int64
  semantics, so values at or above `$80000000` format correctly. `IntToHex64`
  remains available.

## Busy / overlap semantics

The contract advertises one process-wide script execution token shared by daemon script runs and GUI Apply Script. `supports.scripts.execution.overlapPolicy` is `single-process-single-runner`, and the possible holders are `daemon` and `gui`.

If the token is already held, clients should expect a failed `scripts.run` response with `error.code: "script_busy"` and `error.details.holder` naming the active holder. The GUI-held overlap is proven by manual GUI evidence: a daemon `scripts.run` was attempted while GUI Apply Script held the token, and the response returned `script_busy` with `error.details.holder: "gui"`.

The daemon-held mirror case remains **Not Covered** for an architectural reason, not because the response shape is undefined: daemon `scripts.run` executes synchronously on the GUI thread, freezing the GUI message pump while the daemon holds the guard. A user click queued during that freeze cannot reach the GUI Apply Script guard-acquire boundary until after the daemon releases the token, so the normal operator path cannot witness a GUI-side `script_busy` refusal for holder `daemon`. This is covered by the architectural rationale in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, which also cites the shared guard call sites.

## Locator/path lookup rules

Record and element locators use the stable `{file, formId, path}` shape. The locator audit captured `root-locator.json` with `file: "Fallout4.esm"`, `formId: "0000003C"`, and `path: ""`, and `nested-path.json` with a nested `locator.path` of `"[0]"` echoed as `object.path: "[0]"`.

Load-order FormID lookup remains the primary identity rule; file-local lookup is a compatibility carve-out, not a second addressing model. The audit artifact `load-order-lookup.json` found six hits for FormID `0000003C`, including the `Fallout4.esm` hit, and included both `masterOrSelf` and `winningOverride` readback fields.

## ChildGroup navigation (0.13)

Phase 15A adds a read-side navigation layer for xEdit ChildGroup-owned content without adding new verbs. Clients keep using `elements.children`, `elements.get`, and record locators; the only new locator vocabulary is the synthetic `\Child Group` prefix.

### Prefix grammar

Locator paths starting with `\Child Group` engage ChildGroup-aware resolution. The full grammar:

- `\Child Group` — the owning record's ChildGroup (a sibling `IwbGroupRecord`).
- `\Child Group\<sub-label>` — a named sub-group or named child inside the ChildGroup.
- `\Child Group\<sub-label>\...` — further descent (WRLD only, for Block / Sub-Block).

Prefix detection is tight: only the exact `\Child Group` path or a path beginning `\Child Group\` enters the ChildGroup resolver. Other paths preserve the existing locator behavior.

### Parent record signatures and sub-label vocabulary

| Parent | GroupType | Sub-labels |
|---|---:|---|
| CELL | 6 | `Persistent`, `Temporary`, `Visible when Distant` |
| WRLD | 1 | `Persistent` (returns persistent worldspace CELL record), `Block <X>, <Y>`, `Block <X>, <Y>\Sub-Block <X>, <Y>` |
| DIAL | 7 | (none — contents are INFOs surfaced directly) |
| QUST | 10 | (none — contents are DLBR/SCEN/DIAL surfaced directly; only present when `wbVWDAsQuestChildren=True`) |

### Round-trip example

The WRLD walk uses ordinary `elements.children` breadcrumbs for every step:

1. `records.get { file:"Fallout4.esm", formId:"0000003C", path:"" }` returns the Commonwealth `WRLD` record.
2. `elements.children` on that WRLD root appends a trailing child with `object.kind:"child_group"` and `locator.path:"\\Child Group"`.
3. `elements.children` on `path:"\\Child Group"` returns the persistent worldspace CELL as a flat record locator plus `child_group` stubs such as `path:"\\Child Group\\Block 0, 0"`.
4. `elements.children` on a Block stub returns Sub-Block stubs such as `path:"\\Child Group\\Block 0, 0\\Sub-Block 0, 0"`.
5. `elements.children` on a Sub-Block stub returns exterior CELL records with flat FormID locators; a returned CELL record's own `elements.children` can then expose its `Temporary` ChildGroup and REFR/ACHR/etc. child records, again as flat record locators.

### Asymmetries

- READ-only: synthetic `\Child Group` paths resolve through `elements.get`, `elements.children`, and other read-side element lookup surfaces.
- Mutation verbs (`elements.set_value`, `elements.set_native_value`, `elements.add_child`, `elements.remove_child`, `elements.copy_child_to`, movement verbs, etc.) reject synthetic ChildGroup paths with `error.code:"invalid_target"`. To mutate a child record, use its flat FormID locator, which is what the breadcrumb emitted by `elements.children` always uses for records.

### Empty group suppression

ChildGroups with zero immediate children are suppressed; no stub appears. This is content-aware behavior, not a defect. Clients should treat the absence of a stub as "no ChildGroup content".

### Block / Sub-Block coordinate format

Block and Sub-Block labels use signed decimal coordinates matching xEdit GUI `ShortName` output, including the space after the comma: `Block 0, 0`, `Block -3, 2`, `Sub-Block 0, 1`.

## apply_filter extensions (0.14, extended in 0.20)

Phase 15B extends the existing `records.apply_filter` discovery verb. Phase 15G
keeps the same verb and generalizes the identifier `*Pattern` / `*Regex` fields
to accept either a scalar string or an array of strings. Existing scalar glob
fields and response fields keep their previous meaning.

### New argument families

- `parentFormId`: load-order FormID string. A candidate record matches when its
  xEdit container/ChildGroup ownership chain contains that MainRecord. This is an
  AND predicate with all other filters.
- Regex alternatives to existing glob fields:
  - `editorIdRegex`
  - `displayNameRegex`
  - `fullNameRegex`
  - `baseEditorIdRegex`
  - `baseDisplayNameRegex`

As of contract `0.20`, each of these ten identifier fields accepts either a
single string or an array of strings:

- `editorIdPattern`, `editorIdRegex`
- `displayNamePattern`, `displayNameRegex`
- `fullNamePattern`, `fullNameRegex`
- `baseEditorIdPattern`, `baseEditorIdRegex`
- `baseDisplayNamePattern`, `baseDisplayNameRegex`

A scalar string is interpreted exactly as before. An array is evaluated with OR
semantics inside that field; predicates across different fields remain ANDed.
Arrays must contain 1..32 strings. Empty arrays, arrays longer than 32, and
non-string entries return `invalid_request` with `error.details.invalidField`
naming the malformed field.

Regex fields use `System.RegularExpressions.TRegEx` with `roIgnoreCase` and
`roCompiled`. Matching is partial by default; callers should add `^` / `$` when
they want anchoring.

### Timeout behavior

Each regex evaluation is bounded by a 100ms `TTask.Wait` wall-time check on the
daemon's main filter loop. The underlying `TRegEx.IsMatch` call is not
interruptible in this RTL, so a timed-out worker may finish later in the
background; the wait bounds daemon responsiveness, not worker lifetime. The daemon
treats that per-record wait expiry as a non-match and increments optional
`result.regexTimeouts`.

The regex worker pool is capped at four in-flight tasks. If all four slots are
already occupied by still-running workers, the candidate record is skipped without
starting another worker and optional `result.regexSlotsExhausted` is incremented
instead of `result.regexTimeouts`. Both fields are omitted when zero. Clients
should debug `regexTimeouts` as slow per-record evaluation and
`regexSlotsExhausted` as saturation under load or repeated slow patterns. Clients
should also avoid catastrophic-backtracking patterns; a future Phase 16+ Tier 2
slice is expected to move regex evaluation behind subprocess isolation for real
wall-time worker termination.

### Conflict and invalid-regex errors

Do not provide both glob and regex for the same identifier family. For example,
`editorIdPattern` plus `editorIdRegex` returns `invalid_request` with
`error.details.invalidField: "editorIdRegex"`.

Invalid regex syntax also returns `invalid_request` with `invalidField` naming the
bad regex argument.

This conflict rule applies regardless of scalar or array shape. For example,
`editorIdPattern:["*Steel*"]` plus `editorIdRegex:"Steel"` is rejected the
same way as two scalar fields.

### Example

```json
{
  "command": "records.apply_filter",
  "args": {
    "files": ["Fallout4.esm"],
    "signatures": ["REFR"],
    "parentFormId": "00000025",
    "displayNameRegex": ["picket fence", "chair"],
    "limit": 25
  }
}
```

Expected success shape is unchanged except for optional regex observability
metadata:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "records.apply_filter",
  "result": {
    "truncated": false,
    "hits": [],
    "count": 0,
    "regexTimeouts": 1,
    "regexSlotsExhausted": 1
  }
}
```

## references recursive descent (0.15; retained paging in 0.60)

Phase 15C extends `records.references` with one optional argument:

- `recursive` (boolean, default `false`): when omitted or false, the command keeps
  the pre-0.15 shallow behavior and scans only the addressed record's own element
  tree. When true, xEdit selects child roots using native `wbGetSiblingRecords`
  semantics: the root's own child group plus later parent overrides, highest
  scoped file version per FormID. Root payload precedes selected child payload
  in native FormID order. Selection stops at main records and does not follow
  links transitively or replace children with outside-scope global winners.

The `supports.referencesRecursive` block advertises:

- `defaultRecursive: false`
- `appliesTo: ["CELL", "WRLD", "DIAL", "QUST"]`
- `dedupBy: "file-and-loadOrderFormId"`
- `limitSemantics: "post-union-post-dedup"`

Deduplication spans all pages. `limit` is a page size (1..500); drain identical
arguments plus `nextCursor`, including empty continuation pages, until
`complete:true`. Contract 0.60 retains selection and incremental sorting within
5,000 work units / soft 100 ms per page, and reports `traversal` phase/counters,
`semanticRevision`, and `cursorRetained`. No own child group does not exclude
later parent override groups. Native calls remain indivisible; exceeding root,
selection, payload, depth or retained-memory limits ends with explicit
`incomplete:true` and a reason, never a complete prefix. See
`Tools/AutomationRegression/README.md` for limits and native acceptance commands.

Example:

```json
{
  "command": "records.references",
  "args": {
    "file": "Fallout4.esm",
    "formId": "00000025",
    "path": "",
    "recursive": true,
    "limit": 100
  }
}
```

The success envelope remains `{ "truncated": bool, "hits": [...], "count": n }`.

## conflict_status ChildGroup (0.15)

Phase 15C adds an optional `result.childGroup` sub-block to
`records.conflict_status`. It is omitted entirely when the addressed record has no
ChildGroup or when the ChildGroup is empty.

When present, the block contains:

- `count`: number of ChildGroup-owned child main records included in the scan.
- `hasConflict`: true when any scanned child record reports a non-peaceful xEdit
  conflict state.
- `signatures`: object keyed by child record signature. Each value has `total`
  and `conflicting` counts.
- `conflictingHits`: capped array of shallow record stubs for conflicting child
  records. Entries reuse the normal record summary/locator shape and include a
  shallow `conflict` object.
- `conflictingHitsTruncated`: true when more than 20 conflicting child records
  were found.

The `supports.conflictStatusChildGroup` block advertises the sub-block key, field
names, omission rule, and `conflictingHitsMax: 20`. Existing main-record
`record`, `conflict`, and `children` fields are unchanged; clients that ignore the
new key keep pre-0.15 behavior.

## records.create parent-spec (0.16, extended in 0.18)

Phase 15D extends `records.create` with an optional `parent` object for authoring
new records into ChildGroup-owning parents without introducing a new verb.

### Request shape

Existing top-level creation remains valid:

```json
{
  "command": "records.create",
  "args": {
    "targetFile": "patch.esp",
    "signature": "KYWD"
  }
}
```

Parent-spec creation adds:

```json
{
  "command": "records.create",
  "args": {
    "targetFile": "patch.esp",
    "signature": "REFR",
    "parent": {
      "file": "patch.esp",
      "formId": "00000025",
      "subGroup": "Temporary"
    }
  }
}
```

`parent.file` and `parent.formId` address the parent main record. For writable
patch authoring, use a parent record owned by `targetFile` (for example, copy the
CELL/DIAL/QUST override first), then create the child record under that parent.

### Supported parents

| Parent | Child target | `subGroup` |
|---|---|---|
| `CELL` | Cell ChildGroup sub-GRUP | Optional: `Persistent`, `Temporary`, `Visible when Distant` |
| `DIAL` | DIAL ChildGroup | Not allowed |
| `QUST` | QUST ChildGroup | Not allowed |
| `WRLD` | WRLD ChildGroup world CELL | `Persistent` or `coords:[x,y]` |

When `CELL.subGroup` is omitted, default selection is:

- `REFR`, `ACHR`, `PGRD`, `LAND`, `NAVM` -> `Temporary`
- all other signatures -> `Persistent`

For `WRLD` parents, `signature` must be `CELL`. Two mutually exclusive shapes are
supported: `parent.subGroup:"Persistent"` returns or creates the persistent
worldspace CELL, and `parent.coords:[x,y]` returns or creates the exterior CELL at
signed int16 grid coords through xEdit's native `CELL[x,y]` path. Supplying both
or neither shape returns `invalid_request`.

### Capability block

`supports.createParentSpec` advertises:

- `supportedParents: ["CELL", "DIAL", "QUST", "WRLD"]`
- `subGroupVocabulary.CELL: ["Persistent", "Temporary", "Visible when Distant"]`
- `subGroupVocabulary.WRLD: ["Persistent"]`
- `defaultSubGroup.CELL` for the default signature heuristic
- `unsupportedParents: []` in 0.18+ (retained for 0.16-era clients; no parent
  signatures are currently deferred)
- `wrldDeferralReason: "superseded-by-0.18"` in 0.18+ (sentinel retained so the
  former deferral field evolves additively instead of disappearing)
- `wrldCoords: true`
- `wrldRequiresCellSignature: true`

Signature validity is still native xEdit behavior. The CLI does not add a
protocol-side allowlist for which signatures can be created under a parent.

## elements.children pagination (0.17)

Phase 15H extends the existing `elements.children` progressive-disclosure verb
with offset pagination so dense ChildGroups stay below the named-pipe response
ceiling without adding a streaming protocol or a new verb.

### Arguments

- `limit` (integer, optional): default `200`; valid range `1..1000` inclusive.
  `0`, negative values, values above `1000`, and non-integers return
  `invalid_request`.
- `offset` (integer, optional): default `0`; valid range `>= 0`. Negative values
  and non-integers return `invalid_request`.

### Response shape

The existing `children` array remains. Four additive fields appear beside it:

```json
{
  "children": [
    { "locator": { "file": "Fallout4.esm", "formId": "00013A9D", "path": "" }, "object": { "kind": "record", "signature": "REFR" } }
  ],
  "count": 1,
  "total": 742,
  "offset": 0,
  "truncated": true
}
```

- `count`: number of entries returned in this response page. The Phase 15A
  synthetic ChildGroup stub counts as a returned entry when present.
- `total`: native immediate-child count for the addressed container. It does not
  include synthetic ChildGroup stubs.
- `offset`: the requested offset echoed back.
- `truncated`: true when more native children exist after the returned page.

### ChildGroup stub interaction

For a main record with a non-empty `IwbMainRecord.ChildGroup`, the
`object.kind:"child_group"` navigation stub is appended only on the first page
(`offset:0`). Later pages do not repeat it. The stub is appended after the native
children in that page, counts toward `count`, and never counts toward `total`.

### Examples

Single page:

```json
{
  "command": "elements.children",
  "args": { "file": "Fallout4.esm", "formId": "000001F4", "path": "" }
}
```

Returns `count == total`, `offset == 0`, and `truncated == false`.

Multiple pages:

```json
{
  "command": "elements.children",
  "args": {
    "file": "Fallout4.esm",
    "formId": "00000025",
    "path": "\\Child Group\\Temporary",
    "limit": 200,
    "offset": 200
  }
}
```

For the accepted FO4 fixture this returns `count:200`, `total:742`,
`offset:200`, and `truncated:true`.

Beyond total:

Returns `children:[]`, `count:0`, `total:742`, `offset:10000`, and
`truncated:false`.

## reverse navigation parent relation (0.19)

Phase 15F extends existing read verbs with an optional `includeParents` boolean.
The default is `false`; omitting it preserves the pre-0.19 response shape.

### Arguments

`includeParents:true` is accepted by:

- `records.get`
- `records.find_by_form_id`
- `records.find_by_editor_id`
- `records.master_or_self`
- `records.winning_override`
- `elements.get`
- `elements.children`

### Response shape

When requested, the addressed record or returned entry includes
`relations.parents`. Entries reuse the standard shallow record summary shape:

```json
{
  "relations": {
    "parents": [
      {
        "locator": { "file": "Fallout4.esm", "formId": "00000025", "path": "" },
        "object": { "kind": "record", "signature": "CELL", "formId": "00000025" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Parent order is nearest-first (for example, `REFR -> CELL -> WRLD`). Top-level
records return an explicitly empty `parents: []` when requested. If
`includeParents` is omitted or false, `relations.parents` is absent.

### Capability block

`supports.reverseNavigation` advertises:

- `optInArg: "includeParents"`
- `appliesTo`: the seven verbs listed above
- `maxAncestorDepth: 16`
- `ordering: "nearest-first"`
- `relationKey: "parents"`

## Save / durability semantics

`session.get_dirty_state` reports both unsaved in-memory changes and deferred
rename state:

```json
{
  "dirtyFiles": [],
  "unsavedChangeCount": 0,
  "dirty": false,
  "pendingShutdownFiles": [
    {
      "tempFile": "Patch.esp.save.2026_08_11_12_34_56",
      "file": { "name": "Patch.esp", "fileName": "Patch.esp" }
    }
  ],
  "pendingShutdownCount": 1
}
```

`session.save` is the explicit save seam. A successful response reports what
xEdit did during that save operation:

- `savedFilesNow`: files saved immediately in that call.
- `savedFilesPendingShutdown`: files whose save succeeded but whose final rename/durability is deferred until shutdown.
- `savedNowCount` and `savePendingShutdownCount`: counts for the two arrays.
- `dirtyState`: dirty-state readback after the save operation.

For an already-loaded memory-mapped plugin, xEdit writes the saved bytes to a
`<name>.save.<timestamp>` temp file in the data path and queues the rename onto
the final module name. That rename is deferred until process exit or
`session.flush`. Saving clears the plugin's modified flag, so `dirty:false` can
coexist with `pendingShutdownCount > 0`; pending readback is the lifecycle
all-clear companion to dirty state, not another form of dirty state. Both
`session.get_dirty_state` and `session.save.result.dirtyState` use this shape.

Clients can discover the readback through `supports.pendingSaveReadback: true`.

A successful `session.save` response is not by itself a fresh-restart durability
proof. Strong durability claims need `session.flush` or a later process-exit plus
fresh-relaunch readback. The earlier durability audit captured:

- `audits\save-now.json`: `savedNowCount: 1`, `savePendingShutdownCount: 0`, and `dirtyState.dirty: false` for a newly created first-save file.
- `audits\save-pending.json`: `savedNowCount: 0`, `savePendingShutdownCount: 1`, and `dirtyState.dirty: false` after reloading an already-on-disk target, mutating it again, and saving.
- `audits\save-pending-after-restart.json`: a fresh daemon readback found the second saved keyword in `VT_AutomationAudit_Pending_rerun2_20260508.esp`, proving the pending-shutdown response needed the explicit restart/readback step for a strong durability claim.

See `examples/05-save-durability.md` for the wrapper-facing save example and the locator/durability audit for the corresponding audit table.

## `session.flush` (0.23)

`session.flush` is a `session-mutation` command and therefore requires daemon
consent (`-IKnowWhatImDoing`). It snapshots dirty state, drains the pending-rename
queue in-band, reports each rename, and arms a clean daemon self-exit. The serve
loop writes and flushes the complete response bytes before honoring that exit;
once exit is armed, no further commands are accepted.

Optional argument:

- `force` (boolean, default `false`). Without it, a pre-flush dirty state with
  unsaved modified files returns `state_conflict`, because those files are not in
  the pending-rename queue. Call `session.save` first or explicitly pass
  `force:true` to accept discarding those unsaved changes during exit.

Success response:

```json
{
  "flushedFiles": [
    { "fileName": "Patch.esp", "renamed": true }
  ],
  "pendingRemaining": [],
  "pendingRemainingCount": 0,
  "dirtyState": {
    "dirtyFiles": [],
    "unsavedChangeCount": 0,
    "dirty": false,
    "pendingShutdownFiles": [
      {
        "tempFile": "Patch.esp.save.2026_08_11_12_34_56",
        "file": { "name": "Patch.esp", "fileName": "Patch.esp" }
      }
    ],
    "pendingShutdownCount": 1
  }
}
```

Each `flushedFiles` entry contains `fileName`, `renamed`, and optional `error`.
`pendingRemaining` is an array of file-name strings (not objects) for the pairs
still queued after the drain. A failed rename remains queued for the normal
process-exit retry and stays visible in `pendingRemaining`. The returned
`dirtyState` is the pre-drain snapshot used by
the safety check, so it still shows pending entries that the same response reports
as successfully drained. An empty pending queue follows the same
unambiguous lifecycle: the command returns empty arrays and then exits.

Clients can discover this command through `supports.sessionFlush: true`.

## Client parsing rules

- Do not parse prose in `error.message` or script `messages` to decide control flow.
- Branch on `error.code`.
- Use documented `error.details` keys only.
- Treat `messages` as ordered observational output for operators and diagnostics.
- Ignore unknown keys for forward compatibility.
- Ignore unknown `object.kind` values for forward compatibility; `child_group` is additive in 0.13 and future kinds may appear.
- Keep `scripts.run` outside `jobs.*`; it is synchronous and non-cancelable in this contract.

## 0.9 — Consent gate (`consent_required`)

Mutating daemon commands now require the daemon to have been launched with `-IKnowWhatImDoing`.

When the flag is absent, mutating commands fail at the request boundary with:

- `error.code: "consent_required"`
- `error.details.deniedReason: "iknowwhatimdoing-required"`
- `error.details.commandName: <the rejected command>`
- `error.details.mutationCategory: <the policy classifier category>`

This is a request-validation tier refusal. No script lifecycle has started yet, so no `messages`, `messagesTruncated`, `ranInitialize`, `ranFinalize`, or `processed` fields appear on this error code.

Read-only commands are unaffected.

`script_runtime_error` remains reserved for real script execution failures after execution starts; consent refusal is never reported through that lifecycle code.

The capability descriptor `result.supports.scripts.execution.iKnowWhatImDoing` reflects the daemon's current launch state.

See `examples/06-consent-required.md` for a source-linked example.
